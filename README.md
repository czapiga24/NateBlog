The website I created is a basic blog site developed using HTML. It is hosted on Azure with a free Azure domain for accessibility. For security, the website is protected by an SSL certificate, Web Application Firewall (WAF), and Azure Front Door. In Azure, I have set up multiple Virtual Machines (VMs), an App Service for hosting the website, and various resource groups, network security groups, load balancers, a Key Vault for securely storing sensitive information, and a virtual network to manage the network traffic.
